This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overwiew
A simple todos app built using react, redux, redux saga and material ui.

## Access
* You view [DEMO](https://todos-508d9.firebaseapp.com/) hosted on firebase here.
* You can also serve it yourself using the files in the build folder.

## Features
* Add, view, remove and mark todos as complete
* Filter todos by seasonal themes
  * Winter theme is Black and White
  * Spring theme is foresty

## Note
ES6 features are used through out such as:
* arrow functions

* Functional programming is observed by not mutating state using redux reducers.
* Everything is modularized for easy reuse.
